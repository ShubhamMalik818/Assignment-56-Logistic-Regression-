    "Q1.  What is the purpose of grid search cv in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS- Grid search CV is a technique used in machine learning to find the best hyperparameters for a model. Hyperparameters are the settings of a \n",
    "     model that are not learned from the data. For example, the number of trees in a random forest or the learning rate of a neural network are \n",
    "     hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV works by evaluating a model with different hyperparameter settings on a hold-out dataset. The hyperparameter settings that result in \n",
    "the best performance on the hold-out dataset are then used to train the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how grid search CV works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let say we have a random forest model with hyperparameters:\n",
    "    1.1 n_estimators: The number of trees in the forest.\n",
    "    1.2 max_depth: The maximum depth of each tree.\n",
    "    1.3 min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split a node.\n",
    "2. We want to find the best hyperparameter settings for our model.\n",
    "3. We create a grid of hyperparameter settings:\n",
    "    3.1 n_estimators: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",

    "                     of the model and to select the best hyperparameter settings.\n",
    "2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model. Cross-validation works by dividing the dataset into \n",
    "                     multiple folds. The model is then trained on a subset of the folds and evaluated on the remaining folds. This process is repeated \n",
    "                     multiple times, and the average performance of the model is used to evaluate the model's performance."
